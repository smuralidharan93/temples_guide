# 📱 Mobile App Installation (Android & iOS)

This application is built as a **Progressive Web App (PWA)**, meaning you can install it directly to your home screen without going through the App Store or Play Store.

## Step 1: Open the App
Open the `index.html` file in your mobile browser.
*(Note: To install as PWA, you might need to host this on a static web server like GitHub Pages or Netlify. If opening locally, it works as a webpage)*.

2. Select **"Install App"** or **"Add to Home Screen"**.
3. Confirm by tapping **Add**.

### iOS (Safari)

2. Scroll down and tap **"Add to Home Screen"**.
3. Tap **Add** in the top-right corner.
